    <fieldset style="position:relative"><legend>Toggle features</legend>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="scaler" /> Show uploads predating March 2012 in big size</label>
            <div><p>Up until 2012 Flickr had always updated the full database of photos when new browsing-sizes was introduced
                on the site. However in May 2012 only photos uploaded after March 2012 was updated when Flickr introduced
                1600px and 2048px wide browsing-sizes, leaving the majority of photos to be displayed only 1024px wide.
                Flickr Fixr fixes this by scaling, and when the original is available, using the original uploaded photo for
                best possible quality.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="albumTeaser" /> Album-teaser column on photostreams</label>
            <div><p>Puts a column featuring albums on photographer's photostream. The 10 first albums as
                sorted in Flickr Organizer are shown in the column.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="updateTags" /> Direct tag-links to <em>same</em> photographer's photos</label>
            <div><p>Adds an extra direct link in tags, pointing to the same photographer's similar tagged photos.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="albumExtras" /> Links to album-map and album-comments</label>
            <div><p>Adds two extra links in "album headers". One link pointing to a map with current album's photos, and another
                link pointing to the old hidden/forgotten page with album comments, which also is a great page for reading
                long album descriptions.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="updateMapLink" /> Extra and improved map links on photos</label>
            <div><p>Adds the photo you came  from to the image-ribbon, when opening Flickr Map on a photo. Also "opens" the
                photo, but it's a 90% fix: To see exactly where it was geotagged, click twice on the photo in the image-ribbon
                to close and re-open it; Now a star showing the exact position of photo appears. <em>Bonus:</em> Also adds a
                link to show geoposition on Google Maps.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="topPagination" /> Top-pagination for fast an easy navigation</label>
            <div><p>Adds a pagination-bar when hovering mouse just in top of the photostreams, albumpages, favorite collections,
                ("beta experience") group pools and on the Explore page.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="exploreCalendar" /> Explore Calendar and Recent Uploads</label>
            <div><p>On the Explore page, add a link to the hidden/forgotten Explore Calendar and to page showing some of the latest
                uploads to Flickr. A little warning regarding the latest upload though. Even though Safe Search is activated on
                that page, you risk seeing stuff you might have preferred not to see.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="topMenuItems" /> Extra top menu items</label>
            <div><p>Adds Tags, Collections and Map items to both the user ("You" dropdown) and the photographer menus (menu bar).</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="photoDates" /> Extended date &amp; time info on photopages</label>
            <div><p>Via mouseover, show both Taken and Upload dates in detail when available. Taken date will also work as a
                link to more photos from the same photographer.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="orderWarning" /> Warn if photostream <em>ain't</em> ordered by upload date</label>
            <div><p>When browsing a photostream in <em>Date taken</em>em> order, a subtle visual hint will warn you that the
                latest added photos might not be on top of photostream.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="ctrlClicking" /> New tab fix for Firefox</label>
            <div><p>If you have your Firefox configured to open tabs in the "background" when ctrl-clicking links, you may have
                seen Flickr overriding this preference on search result pages (including the Trending Tags pages) and bring
                immediately focus to new tabs instead. This should prevent Flickr overriding your open tabs preferences.
                I have only seen the problem when using Firefox, so feature is default disabled for other browsers.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div><label><input type="checkbox" id="shootingSpaceballs" /> Allow image context menu on "All sizes" pages</label>
            <div><p>Removes layer over images on "All sizes" pages, so you can use your browser's context menu for images. I have
                been silent about this feature, because I don't want Flickr Fixr to be a tool for people who want to use
                other peoples photos without permission. But I have image tools like "Search Similar image" and "EXIF viewer"
                which I would like to access via the context menu. <em>Please respect ownership of images, and remember to ask
                permission for any public use of other peoples photos, if not already granted by an attached license.</em></p></div>
        </div>
        <div><button type="submit" class="browser-style">Save</button></div>
        <p>You will have to reload any already open Flickr webpages to enable updated settings.</p>
